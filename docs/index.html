                </div>
                <div class="about-content">
                    <p>The goal of our project was to develop a low-cost system which can autonomously learn the typical 
                        behavior of a machine and alert users when anomalies occur.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/ourgoal.png" width="500px">
                    <p>Why do we want to do this? The IIoT offers manufacturers vast benefits and is projected to result in tens of 
                        billions of dollars in improved profits for manufacturers. However, manufacturers do not know how to make use 
                        of the data they collect so much of the data is not used.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/motivation.png" width="800px" >
                    <p>Our developed application is provides a low-cost, easy to implement solution so that manufacturers of all sizes 
                        can rapidly deploy smart edge devices and begin getting actionable insights into industrial processes out-of-the-box
                         with minimal investment in time and money. </p>

                    <h2>How it Works</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="about-content">
                    <p>To acheive this, we developed an application that is deployed in three stages. In the final deployment stage, the 
                        application classifies sounds as normal or anomalous, but before it can get there it first goes through an initialization and training phase.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/stages.png" width="600px">
                    <p>In the initialization stage, a Gaussian Mixture Model with two gaussians is used to determine the threshold that distinguishes between the off 
                        and on states. The means of each distribution are compared to ensure distinct states are found.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/initialization.png" width="800px">
                    <p>The typical sound from a machine is then learned using a principal components analysis (PCA) based approach which has been proven in past research 
                        to be successful at classifying anomalous sounds. In this process, the log-mel-spectrogram of the raw sound data is computed and PCA is performed 
                        on the spectrogram. After performing PCA, the distance from each component to the average of the training data is computed resulting in a point in 
                        a 3-dimensional space. Finally, the mahalanobis distance is computed in to get the anomaly score.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/pca.png" width="800px">
                    <p>We tested the process using the MIMII dataset which contains sound data for malfunction machines. The dataset has devices in 4 categories including 
                        fans, pumps, sliders, and valves. The classification resulted in an f-score of at least 80 in all categories.</p>
                    <img src="images/testing.png" width="600px">
                    <p>To support the application, we built a cloud architecture which uses MQTT to transmit status and alert messaged from the edge devices. All messages 
                        are stored in a SQL database, and in the case of alarms can be optionally sent directly to users. Amazon Web Services is used for the orchestration 
                        of cloud services and data storage. Finally, a made a prototype user dashboard using github pages. A demonstration is available on this webpage by 
                        going to the Demo tab of clicking <a href="demo.html">here</a>.
